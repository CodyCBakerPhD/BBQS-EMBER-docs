# EMBER-Vault: Submission of Multimodal Human Data (BIDS + NWB)

EMBER-Vault is the subsystem of the EMBER archive designed to store and control access to sensitive human data, including human health data and identifiable human data. It is suitable for human neural and behavioral experiments with sensitive data, and is not appropriate for open data release or animal data. It is compliant and aligned with relevant standards for PHI/PII data storage.

For more in-depth information on the recommended data standardization workflow, see the guide on [data standardization](data-standardization.md)

Your team will standardize and validate data client side, then upload to the EMBER-Vault archive using Globus. This resource is under active development, and we anticipate EMBER-Vault will be available soon!
